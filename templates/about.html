<h2>iPXE based bootserver</h2>
<p>
This application is designed to ease the installation of <a target="_blank" href="http://debian.org">debian</a> operating system
by automating the bulk of the interaction in the installation process.
</p><p>
It leverages the excellent PXE boot environment <a target="_blank" href="http://ipxe.org">iPXE</a> using a 
<a target="_blank" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> based python application to provide ipxe menus, debian-installer scripts and post install scripts.
</p><p>
Depending on system config and your choice of image it also uses <a target="_blank" href="http://saltstack.org">Salt stack</a>
to provide configuration management and orchestration of systems.
</p><p> 
The basic premise of the boot server is to provide a simple and reliable way to deploy and configure
linux servers with a minimum of mess and fuss. The aim is to be able to deploy, redeploy and build
complex linux systems in hours rather than days.
