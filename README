This is exarch a recursive boot server.

It has been through about 5 complete rewrites over the last 5 or 6 years but now it can boot itself...

The basic sequence:

1. download the iso and boot
2. grab a login/menu over http from exarch 
3. get a kernel boot line
4. get a initrd.gz and kernel file
5. boot into debian
6. grab a preseed file from exarch
7. install debain
8. add a post install script
9. reboot ...
10. run post install script
11. installs saltstack as a master and runs highstate
12. adds all the needed components ( apache , python, flask, compiler, etc )
13. checks out exarch and the ipxe source code
14. installs this application
15. compiles a new iso for this machine
16. reboots ...

Now you are back at step one with new server.

This is an alpha/developer release

It will update /srv/(salt|reactor|pillar) every three hours and run high state on itself.
